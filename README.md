### Readme 
## To do list ... Now and then.

In the evolving landscape of software dedicated to boosting productivity, two versions of a Python-based application, namely todolist.py and todolist2.py, stand out prominently. The initial version, todolist.py, was crafted in April 2023 and embodied a fundamental approach to task management. In stark contrast, todolist2.py, conceived more recently, has introduced significant advancements both in terms of user interaction and functionality.

The original todolist.py is characterized by its simplicity and straightforwardness. As a primary iteration, it focuses merely on the essentials: creating a list where tasks can be added and marked off upon completion. This version lacks any form of visual interface and operates entirely through command-line inputs by the user.

On the other hand, todolist2.py showcases a leap in development, stepping up both in usability and complexity. A standout feature is its graphical user interface (GUI), which provides a more user-friendly and intuitive way for users to interact with their tasks. This enhancement not only makes the application more accessible but also more appealing to a broader audience.

Moreover, todolist2.py introduces a robust system for memory management, allowing the tasks to be saved and retrieved even after the application is closed. This capability ensures that users can maintain continuity in their task management without needing to re-enter information every time they open the application.

In summary, the transition from todolist.py to todolist2.py marks significant progress in user experience and functionality. This evolution from a basic script to a more sophisticated application with a GUI and memory integration demonstrates a keen understanding of user needs and technological advancement. Both versions serve as valuable tools, yet todolist2.py undoubtedly enhances productivity with its improved features.

## ðŸ“œ Installation

To get started with this Python application, the setup process has been streamlined to ensure accessibility and ease of use. Users simply need to execute a straightforward command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This command is run in the terminal and facilitates the automatic installation of all necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

This text file, often included in Python projects, itemizes all the libraries and specific versions that the application requires to function optimally. By using pip, Python's package installer, the stated dependencies are efficiently resolved and installed, which might include packages for handling database connections, computational operations, or enhancing the user interface.

Once this installation process is complete, the application will have all the required environment set up, ensuring it runs smoothly on your machine. This method negates the need for manual installation of each dependency, thus reducing potential errors and compatibility issues, making it an extremely straightforward and user-friendly approach to preparing your system for the application.

## ðŸ“œ Usage

To access different versions of the todo list application for various years, users simply need to run specific scripts using Python. These scripts are designated to pull up todo lists according to the year they were designed for:

2023 Todo List: To view and interact with the todo list created for the year 2023, users should open a command line interface and enter the commands `py todolist.py`, `python todolist.py` or `python3 todolist.py`. This command executes the script for the todolist.py file, bringing up the basic and straightforward version of the todo list without a graphical user interface (GUI), focused purely on fundamental task management functionalities.

2024 Todo List: For the more advanced 2024 todo list, users should run the command `py todolist2.py`, `python todolist2.py` or `python3 todolist2.py` in their terminal. This executes the todolist2.py script, which is equipped with enhancements such as a graphical user interface for better user interaction and a memory system to retain tasks even after the application is closed. This version offers a more enriched user experience with added features that leverage the latest in technology advancements.

These commands are specific to each file and version, making it simple for users to switch between different years' lists according to their needs. Each script is tailored to not only fulfill the basic requirements of a todo list but also to align with user expectations and technological standards of its respective time.
